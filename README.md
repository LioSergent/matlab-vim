This repo (like other forks) is just to add a couple of details:
* comment with % when using tpope/commentary
* consider double quotes " as a string delimiter

## Overview

Included is : 
1) Syntax highlighting 
2) Correct indentation 
3) Integration in vim of the mlint Matlab code checker with the :make command 
4) Correct setting to use the matchit.vim script (extension of the % command to match if/end, for/end,... blocks) 
5) Tag support 
6) Help file
